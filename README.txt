RB Tree to BR Tree Efficient conversion
	- This project converts the given RB tree into a BR tree with minimum number of recoloring.
	  A BR tree is a RB tree with the rules swapped for red and black colors.

The Project consists of a driver Main class named RBtoBRtree, a RedBlackTree , a BlackRedTree and a Node class.
Node class represents a node of the said trees.

Inputs
	- The program takes an array of numbers as input. A Rb and BR tree is constructed from these numbers.
      	  The RB tree is then recolored in such a way that it becomes a valid BR tree.

Outputs
	- The program prints three trees - RB tree, RB converted to BR tree, and a BR tree built from ground up.
	  All these can then be compared to see how their nodes differ in colors.
